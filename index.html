<p id="title">AN ABSURD REASONING</p>
<p id="chapter">Absurdity and Suicide</p>
<p id="text">
THERE is but one truly serious philosophical problem, and that is suicide. 
Judging whether life is or is not worth living amounts to answering the fundamental question of philosophy. 
All the rest— whether or not the world has three dimensions, whether the mind has nine or twelve categories—comes afterwards. 
These are games; one must first answer. And if it is true, as Nietzsche claims, that a philosopher, to deserve our respect, 
must preach by example, you can appreciate the importance of that reply, for it will precede the definitive act. 
These are facts the heart can feel; yet they call for careful study before they become clear to the intellect.
</p>
<p id="text">
If I ask myself how to judge that this question is more urgent than that, 
I reply that one judges by the actions it entails. I have never seen anyone die for the ontological argument. 
Galileo, who held a scientific truth of great importance, abjured it with the greatest ease as soon as it endangered his life. 
In a certain sense, he did 
<span id="note1">right.① <span id="note1text">From the point of view of the relative value of truth. On the other hand, from the point of view of virile behavior, this
scholar's fragility may well make us smile.</span></span>
That truth was not worth the stake. Whether the earth or the sun revolves around 
the other is a matter of profound indifference. To tell the truth, it is a futile question. On the other hand, 
I see many people die because they judge that life is not worth living. 
I see others paradoxically getting killed for the ideas or illusions that give them a reason for living 
(what is called a reason for living is also an excellent reason for dying). I therefore conclude that the meaning of life is the most urgent of questions. 
How to answer it? On all essential problems 
(I mean thereby those that run the risk of leading to death or those that intensify the passion of living) 
there are probably but two methods of thought: the method of La Palisse and the method of Don Quixote. 
Solely the balance between evidence and lyricism can allow us to achieve simultaneously emotion and lucidity. 
In a subject at once so humble and so heavy with emotion, the learned and classical dialectic must yield, 
one can see, to a more modest attitude of mind deriving at one and the same time from common sense and understanding.
</p>

<p id="text">
Suicide has never been dealt with except as a social phenomenon. On the contrary, we are concerned here, at the outset, 
with the relationship between individual thought and suicide. An act like this is prepared within the silence of the heart, 
as is a great work of art. The man himself is ignorant of it. One evening he pulls the trigger or jumps. 
Of an apartment-building manager who had killed himself I was told that he had lost his daughter five years before, 
that he had changed greatly since, and that that experience had "undermined" him. A more exact word cannot be imagined. 
Beginning to think is beginning to be undermined. Society has but little connection with such beginnings. 
The worm is in man's heart. That is where it must be sought. 
One must follow and understand this fatal game that leads from lucidity in the face of existence to flight from light.
</p>

<p id="text">
There are many causes for a suicide, and generally the most obvious ones were not the most powerful. 
Rarely is suicide committed (yet the hypothesis is not excluded) through reflection. 
What sets off the crisis is almost always unverifiable. Newspapers often speak of "personal sorrows" or of "incurable illness." 
These explanations are plausible. But one would have to know whether a friend of the desperate man had not that very day addressed him indifferently. 
He is the guilty one. For that is enough to precipitate all the rancors and all the boredom still in 
<span id="note2">suspension.②<span id="note2text">Let us not miss this opportunity to point out the relative character of this essay. 
Suicide may indeed be related to much more honorable considerations—for example, the political suicides of protest, as they were called, 
during the Chinese revolution.  </span></span>
</p>

<p id="text">
But if it is hard to fix the precise instant, the subtle step when the mind opted for death, 
it is easier to deduce from the act itself the consequences it implies. In a sense, and as in melodrama, 
killing yourself amounts to confessing. It is confessing that life is too much for you or that you do not understand it. 
Let's not go too far in such analogies, however, but rather return to everyday words. It is merely confessing that that "is not worth the trouble." 
Living, naturally, is never easy. You continue making the gestures commanded by existence, for many reasons, the first of which is habit. 
Dying voluntarily implies that you have recognized, even instinctively,
the ridiculous character of that habit, the absence of any profound reason for living, 
the insane character of that daily agitation, and the uselessness of suffering.

<p id="text">
What, then, is that incalculable feeling that deprives the mind of the sleep necessary to life? 
A world that can be explained even with bad reasons is a familiar world. But, on the other hand, 
in a universe suddenly divested of illusions and lights, man feels an alien, a stranger. 
His exile is without remedy since he is deprived of the memory of a lost home or the hope of a promised land. 
This divorce between man and his life, the actor and his setting, is properly the feeling of absurdity. 
All healthy men having thought of their own suicide, it can be seen, without further explanation, 
that there is a direct connection between this feeling and the longing for death.
</p>

<p id="text">
The subject of this essay is precisely this relationship between the absurd and suicide, 
the exact degree to which suicide is a solution to the absurd. 
The principle can be established that for a man who does not cheat, 
what he believes to be true must determine his action. 
Belief in the absurdity of existence must then dictate his conduct. 
It is legitimate to wonder, clearly and without false pathos, 
whether a conclusion of this importance requires forsaking as rapidly as possible an incomprehensible condition. 
I am speaking, of course, of men inclined to be in harmony with themselves.
</p>

<p id="text">
Stated clearly, this problem may seem both simple and insoluble. 
But it is wrongly assumed that simple questions involve answers that are no less simple and that evidence implies evidence. 
A priori and reversing the terms of the problem, just as one does or does not kill oneself, it seems that there are but two philosophical solutions, 
either yes or no. This would be too easy. But allowance must be made for those who, without concluding, continue questioning. 
Here I am only slightly indulging in irony: this is the majority. I notice also that those who answer "no" act as if they thought "yes." 
As a matter of fact, if I accept the Nietzschean criterion, they think "yes" in one way or another. On the other hand, 
it often happens that those who commit suicide were assured of the meaning of life. These contradictions are constant. 
It may even be said that they have never been so keen as on this point where, on the contrary, logic seems so desirable. 
It is a commonplace to compare philosophical theories and the behavior of those who profess them. 
But it must be said that of the thinkers who refused a meaning to life none except Kirilov who belongs to literature, 
Peregrinos who is torn of 
<span id="note3">legend,③<span id="note3text">I have heard of an emulator of Peregrinos, a post-war writer who, after having finished his first book, committed suicide to attract
attention to his work. Attention was in fact attracted, but the book was judged no good.</span></span>
 and Jules Lequier who belongs to hypothesis, admitted his logic to the point of refusing that life. 
Schopenhauer is often cited, as a fit subject for laughter, because he praised suicide while seated at a well-set table. 
This is no subject for joking. That way of not taking the tragic seriously is not so grievous, but it helps to judge a man.
</p>

<p id="text">
In the face of such contradictions and obscurities must we conclude that there is no relationship between the opinion one has about life 
and the act one commits to leave it? Let us not exaggerate in this direction. 
In a man' s attachment to life there is something stronger than all the ills in the world. 
The body' s judgment is as good as the mind's, and the body shrinks from annihilation. 
We get into the habit of living before acquiring the habit of thinking. 
In that race which daily hastens us toward death, the body maintains its irreparable lead. 
In short, the essence of that contradiction lies in what I shall call the act of eluding because 
it is both less and more than diversion in the Pascalian sense. Eluding is the invariable game. The typical act of eluding, 
the fatal evasion that constitutes the third theme of this essay, is hope. 
Hope of another life one must "deserve" or trickery of those who live not for life itself but for some great idea that will transcend it, 
refine it, give it a meaning, and betray it.
</p>

<p id="text">
Thus everything contributes to spreading confusion. Hitherto, and it has not been wasted effort, 
people have played on words and pretended to believe that refusing to grant a meaning to life necessarily leads to declaring that it is not worth living. 
In truth, there is no necessary common measure between these two judgments. 
One merely has to refuse to be misled by the confusions, divorces, and inconsistencies previously pointed out. 
One must brush everything aside and go straight to the real problem. One kills oneself because life is not worth living, 
that is certainly a truth—yet an unfruitful one because it is a truism. But does that insult to existence, 
that flat denial in which it is plunged come from the fact that it has no meaning? 
Does its absurdity require one to escape it through hope or suicide—this is what must be clarified, 
hunted down, and elucidated while brushing aside all the rest. Does the Absurd dictate death? 
This problem must be given priority over others, outside all methods of thought and all exercises of the disinterested mind. 
Shades of meaning, contradictions, the psychology that an "objective" mind can always introduce 
into all problems have no place in this pursuit and this passion. It calls simply for an unjust—in other words, 
logical—thought. That is not easy. It is always easy to be logical. It is almost impossible to be logical to the bitter end. 
Men who die by their own hand consequently follow to its conclusion their emotional inclination. 
Reflection on suicide gives me an opportunity to raise the only problem to interest me: 
is there a logic to the point of death? I cannot know unless I pursue, without reckless passion, 
in the sole light of evidence, the reasoning of which I am here suggesting the source. This is what I call an absurd reasoning.
 Many have begun it. I do not yet know whether or not they kept to it.
 </p>
 
 <p id="text">
 When Karl Jaspers, revealing the impossibility of constituting the world as a unity, exclaims: 
 "This limitation leads me to myself, where I can no longer withdraw behind an objective point of view that I am merely representing, 
 where neither I myself nor the existence of others can any longer become an object for me," 
 he is evoking after many others those waterless deserts where thought reaches its confines. 
 After many others, yes indeed, but how eager they were to get out of them! At that last crossroad where thought hesitates, 
 many men have arrived and even some of the humblest. They then abdicated what was most precious to them, 
 their life. Others, princes of the mind, abdicated likewise, but they initiated the suicide of their thought in its purest revolt. 
 The real effort is to stay there, rather, in so far as that is possible, and to examine closely the odd vegetation of those distant regions.
  Tenacity and acumen are privileged spectators of this inhuman show in which absurdity, hope, and death carry on their dialogue. 
  The mind can then analyze the figures of that elementary yet subtle dance before illustrating them and reliving them itself.

<p id="title">AN ABSURD REASONING</p>
<p id="chapter">Absurd Walls</p>
<p id="text">
Like great works, deep feelings always mean more than they are conscious of saying. 
The regularity of an impulse or a repulsion in a soul is encountered again in habits of doing or thinking,
 is reproduced in consequences of which the soul itself knows nothing. Great feelings take with them their own universe, 
 splendid or abject. They light up with their passion an exclusive world in which they recognize their climate. There is 
 a universe of jealousy, of ambition, of selfishness, or of generosity. A universe—in other words, a metaphysic and an 
 attitude of mind. What is true of already specialized feelings will be even more so of emotions basically as indeterminate,
  simultaneously as vague and as "definite," as remote and as "present" as those furnished us by beauty or aroused by absurdity.
</p>
<p id="text">
At any streetcorner the feeling of absurdity can strike any man in the face. As it is, 
in its distressing nudity, in its light without effulgence, it is elusive. But that very difficulty deserves reflection. 
It is probably true that a man remains forever unknown to us and that there is in him something irreducible that escapes us. 
But practically I know men and recognize them by their behavior, by the totality of their deeds, by the consequences caused 
in life by their presence. Likewise, all those irrational feelings which offer no purchase to analysis. I can de-fine them
 practically, appreciate them practically, by gathering together the sum of their consequences in the domain of the intelligence, 
 by seizing and noting all their aspects, by outlining their universe. It is certain that apparently, though I have seen the same 
 actor a hundred times, I shall not for that reason know him any better personally. Yet if I add up the heroes he has personified 
 and if I say that I know him a little better at the hundredth character counted off, this will be felt to contain an element of 
 truth. For this apparent paradox is also an apologue. There is a moral to it. It teaches that a man defines himself by his 
 make- believe as well as by his sincere impulses. There is thus a lower key of feelings, inaccessible in the heart but 
 partially disclosed by the acts they imply and the attitudes of mind they assume. It is clear that in this way I am 
 defining a method. But it is also evident that that method is one of analysis and not of knowledge. For methods 
 imply metaphysics; unconsciously they disclose conclusions that they often claim not to know yet. Similarly, the 
 last pages of a book are already contained in the first pages. Such a link is inevitable. The method defined here 
 acknowledges the feeling that all true knowledge is impossible. Solely appearances can be enumerated and the climate make itself felt.
</p>

<p id="text">
Perhaps we shall be able to overtake that elusive feeling of absurdity in the different but 
closely related worlds of intelligence, of the art of living, or of art itself. The climate
 of absurdity is in the beginning. The end is the absurd universe and that attitude of mind 
 which lights the world with its true colors to bring out the privileged and implacable visage 
 which that attitude has discerned in it.
</p>

<p id="text">
All great deeds and all great thoughts have a ridiculous beginning. Great works are often born on a
street-corner or in a restaurant' s revolving door. So it is with absurdity. 
The absurd world more than others derives its nobility from that abject birth. In certain situations, 
replying "nothing" when asked what one is thinking about may be pretense in a man. Those who are loved
 are well aware of this. But if that reply is sincere, if it symbolizes that odd state of soul in which
  the void becomes eloquent, in which the chain of daily gestures is broken, 
  in which the heart vainly seeks the link that will connect it again, then it is as
   it were the first sign of absurdity.
</p>

<p id="text">
It happens that the stage sets collapse. Rising, street-car, four hours in the office or the factory,
 meal, street-car, four hours of work, meal, sleep, and Monday Tuesday Wednesday Thursday Friday and 
 Saturday according to the same rhythm—this path is easily followed most of the time. But one day the
  "why" arises and everything begins in that weariness tinged with amazement. "Begins"—this is important. 
  Weariness comes at the end of the acts of a mechanical life, but at the same time it inaugurates the impulse of 
  consciousness. It awakens consciousness and provokes what follows. What follows is the gradual return into the 
  chain or it is the definitive awakening. At the end of the awakening comes, in time, the consequence: suicide or 
  recovery. In itself weariness has something sickening about it. Here, I must conclude that it is good. For 
  everything begins with consciousness and nothing is worth anything except through it. There is nothing original about 
  these remarks. But they are obvious; that is enough for a while, during a sketchy reconnaissance in the origins of the absurd. 
  Mere "anxiety," as Heidegger says, is at the source of everything.
</p>

<p id="text">
Likewise and during every day of an unillustrious life, time carries us. But a moment always comes when we have to carry it. 
We live on the future: "tomorrow," "later on," "when you have made your way," "you will understand when you are old enough." 
Such irrelevancies are wonderful, for, after all, it' s a matter of dying. Yet a day comes when a man notices or says that he is thirty. 
Thus he asserts his youth. But simultaneously he situates himself in relation to time. He takes his place in it. 
He admits that he stands at a certain point on a curve that he acknowledges having to travel to its end. He belongs to time, 
and by the horror that seizes him, he recognizes his worst enemy. Tomorrow, he was longing for tomorrow, 
whereas everything in him ought to reject it. That revolt of the flesh is the <span id="note4">absurd.④<span id="note4text">
But not in the proper sense. This is not a definition, but rather an enumeration of the feelings that may admit of the absurd.
Still, the enumeration finished, the absurd has nevertheless not been exhausted.</span></span>
</p>

<p id="text">
A step lower and strangeness creeps in: perceiving that the world is "dense," 
sensing to what a degree a stone is foreign and irreducible to us, 
with what intensity nature or a landscape can negate us. At the heart of all beauty lies something inhuman, 
and these hills, the softness of the sky, the outline of these trees at this very minute lose the illusory 
meaning with which we had clothed them, henceforth more remote than a lost paradise. The primitive hostility 
of the world rises up to face us across millennia. For a second we cease to understand it because for centuries 
we have understood in it solely the images and designs that we had attributed to it beforehand, 
because henceforth we lack the power to make use of that artifice. The world evades us because it becomes 
itself again. That stage scenery masked by habit becomes again what it is. It withdraws at a distance from us. 
Just as there are days when under the familiar face of a woman, we see as a stranger her we had loved months or 
years ago, perhaps we shall come even to desire what suddenly leaves us so alone. But the time has not yet come. 
Just one thing: that denseness and that strangeness of the world is the absurd.
</p>

<p id="text">
Men, too, secrete the inhuman. At certain moments of lucidity, 
the mechanical aspect of their gestures, their meaningless pantomime makes silly everything that surrounds them. 
A man is talking on the telephone behind a glass partition; you cannot hear him, 
but you see his incomprehensible dumb show: you wonder why he is alive. This discomfort in the face of man' s own inhumanity, 
this incalculable tumble before the image of what we are, this "nausea," as a writer of today calls it, is also the absurd.
 Likewise the stranger who at certain seconds comes to meet us in a mirror, the familiar and yet alarming brother we 
 encounter in our own photographs is also the absurd.
</p>

<p id="text">
I come at last to death and to the attitude we have toward it. 
On this point everything has been said and it is only proper to avoid pathos. 
Yet one will never be sufficiently surprised that everyone lives as if no one "knew." 
This is because in reality there is no experience of death. Properly speaking, 
nothing has been experienced but what has been lived and made conscious. 
Here, it is barely possible to speak of the experience of others' deaths. It is a substitute, 
an illusion, and it never quite convinces us. That melancholy convention cannot be persuasive. 
The horror comes in reality from the mathematical aspect of the event. If time frightens us, 
this is because it works out the problem and the solution comes afterward. 
All the pretty speeches about the soul will have their contrary convincingly proved, 
at least for a time. From this inert body on which a slap makes no mark the soul has disappeared. 
This elementary and definitive aspect of the adventure constitutes the absurd feeling. Under the fatal 
lighting of that destiny, its uselessness becomes evident. 
No code of ethics and no effort are justifiable a priori in the face of the cruel mathematics that command our condition.
</p>

<p id="text">
Let me repeat: all this has been said over and over. 
I am limiting myself here to making a rapid classification and to pointing out these obvious themes. 
They run through all literatures and all philosophies. Everyday conversation feeds on them. 
There is no question of reinventing them. But it is essential to be sure of these facts in order to be able to question oneself 
subsequently on the primordial question. I am interested—let me repeat again—not so much in absurd discoveries as in their consequences. 
If one is assured of these facts, what is one to conclude, how far is one to go to elude nothing? 
Is one to die voluntarily or to hope in spite of everything? Beforehand, 
it is necessary to take the same rapid inventory on the plane of the intelligence.
 </p>
 The mind' s first step is to distinguish what is true from what is false. However, as soon as thought
reflects on itself, what it first discovers is a contradiction. Useless to strive to be convincing in this case. 
Over the centuries no one has furnished a clearer and more elegant demonstration of the business than Aristotle: 
"The often ridiculed consequence of these opinions is that they destroy themselves. 
For by asserting that all is true we assert the truth of the contrary assertion and consequently the falsity of our own thesis 
(for the contrary assertion does not admit that it can be true). And if one says that all is false, that assertion is itself false. 
If we declare that solely the assertion opposed to ours is false or else that solely ours is not false, 
we are nevertheless forced to admit an infinite number of true or false judgments. 
For the one who expresses a true assertion proclaims simultaneously that it is true, and so on ad infinitum."
